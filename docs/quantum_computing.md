# Quantum Computers

## Qubit

* Any 2-level quantum system (e.g. electron spin)
* (Quantum) superposition...
  - ...of probabilities between 0 and 1
  - Collapses into a definite state upon measurement
* Entanglement
  - Entangled qubits react to each other instantaneously

Different qubits:

* Logical qubit - Assumed by quantum algorithms
* Physical qubit
  - Hardware operating as a qubit
  - Operates under noisy conditions
* Physical qubit designs
  - Superconducting circuits, josephson junction
  - Trapped ions
  - Quantum dots
  - Nuclear magnetic resonance 
* Quantum error correction
  - Combines multiple physical qubits into on logic qubit
  - One logic qubit needs 100 to 10.000 physical qubits depending on quality

## Quantum Gate

## Quantum Simulation

* Exponentially harder to simulate with a classical computer
  - Scales with the number of qubits required...
  - Typically approximations of a qubit simulated...
* Application...
   - material science -> condensed matter physics (room temperature & pressure superconductors)
   - chemistry -> exactly simulate of structure and behaviour -> medicines, catalysts
* Quantum Supremacy
* Quantum Algorithms
  - Shor's algorithm
