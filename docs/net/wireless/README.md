IEEE **802.11** wireless computer networking standards

* Protocols for implementing **WLAN** (Wireless Local Area Network)
* Basis for the **Wi-Fi** (Wireless Fidelity) brand
* The standard is updated by means of amendments
  - Denoted by 802.11 followed by a non-capitalized letter, e.g. IEEE 802.11a
  - Cf. [list of amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#Standards_and_amendments)

## Physical Layer

Widely used in the **2.4Ghz** and **5Ghz** radio frequencies

- Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band (license free)
- Each spectrum is sub-divided into **channels** with a center frequency and bandwidth
- These wavelengths work best for line-of-sight

Spread spectrum technology:

- DSSS (Direct Sequency Spread Spectrum)
- OFDM (Orthogonal Frequecy-Division Multiplexing)

IEEE 802.11 Standards and Frequency Band

```bash
802.11a	   5GHz
802.11b	   2.4GHz
802.11g	   2.4GHz
802.11n	   2.4 & 5 GHz
802.11ac   below 6GHz
```

### 2.4GHz Frequency Band

**802.11b/g/n** networks operate in the 2.4 GHz band:

- ISM band: 2.400–2.500 GHz
- 14 channels, bandwidth approximately 20 to 22 MHz
- Crowded frequency: Bluetooth, microwaves, telephones, garage door openers...

Not all channels usable for WiFi in all countries:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels#2.4_GHz_(802.11b/g/n/ax)>

Channel overlapping between two adjacent WiFi AP devices cause frequency
interference. Maximum three **non-overlapping channel** can be found in 2.4 GHz
band.

### 5GHz Frequency Band

**802.11a/n/ac** networks operate in the 5 GHz band

- ISM band: 4.915–5.825 GHz spectrum
- Channel width: 802.11n 40MHz, 802.11ac 80MHz
- less crowded 

23 non-overlapping channels but all channels are not usable for all countries

## Operation Modes

Wireless devices called **stations** (STAs)

- Wirelessly connected STAs (at least two) form a basic service set (BSS)
- Controlled by a single **coordination function** (CF)

**Ad-hoc** mode (without an AP)

- Direct communication between two stations (peer-to-peer model)
- Isolated, no connection to other WiFi networks

Infrastructure mode using a wireless **Access Point** (AP)

- STA with additional coordination functions
- Wireless devices must associate to an AP for network access

## Signal Strength

Measured in dBm (decibel milliwatts)

* Absolute number representing power level in mW
* Expressed in negative values
* Logarithmic scale, the closer to 0 dBm, the better the signal is

```
dBm          Quality

-30          Maximum, close to access point
-50          Excellent
-60          Good
-67          Reliable (enough for VoIP, non HD video)
-70          Week (enough for HTTP, mail)
-80          Unreliable
-90          Unusable
```

```bash
wavemon                        # TUI to monitor signal strength
```

RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), relative quality of a received signal
to a client device

Main factors that can weaken your Wi-Fi quality:

* Physical obstruction
* Competing WiFi networks
* Interfering electronics


## Wireless Security 

Cf. [Wireless Security Measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_security#Security_measures)

Protocols:

* **WEP** original encryption protocol superseded by WPA
* **WPA** (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
  - Introduced as an interim security enhancement over WEP
  - Designed to be deployed on existing devices as firmware upgrade
  - "WPA Personal" use a **PSK** (preshared key) for authentication
  - "WPA Enterprise" uses an authentication server to generate keys/certificates
  - Uses TKIP for encryption
* **WPA2**
  - Based on final 802.11i amendment (2004)
  - Uses a 256bit AES key for encryption
  - Support PSK, and EAP authentication methods using RADIUS servers

### EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)

Further improves WPA over the IEEE 802.1X standard

* Authentication framework based on RFC standards
* WPA[2,3] uses EAP as authentication mechanism

EAP type:

* EAP-TLS
* EAP-TTLS (supports other auth. protocols in a TLS tunnel)
* PEAP (encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel)
  - PKI base server certificate
  - EAP-MSCHAPv2 (authenticate to a Microsoft MS_CHAPv2 database)
