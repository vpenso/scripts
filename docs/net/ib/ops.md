## IPoIB

IP over Infiniband (legacy applications)

* ARP over a specific multicast group to convert IP to IB addresses
* TCP/UDP over IPoIB  (IPv4/6)
  - TCP uses reliable-connected mode, MTU up to 65kb
  - UDP uses unreliable-datagram mode, MTU limited to IB packages side 4kb
* MTUs should be synchronized between all components

```bash
netstat -g                                # IP group membership
saquery -g | grep MGID | tr -s '..' | cut -d. -f2
                                          # list mulicast group GIDs
tail -n+1 /sys/class/net/ib*/mode         # connection mode
ibv_devinfo | grep _mtu                   # MTU of the hardware 
/sys/class/net/ib0/device/mlx4_port1_mtu
ip a | grep ib[0-9] | grep mtu | cut -d' ' -f2,4-5
                                          # MTU configuration for the interface
```

## BoIB

Boot over Infiniband (BoIB) is supported with adapter firmware >2.10, and FlexBoot (based on gPXE).

```bash
## Check the firmware version
>>> ibstat | grep Firmware
        Firmware version: 2.11.500
```

FlexBoot is an expansion ROM used to announce the Infiniband HCA to the BIOS as boot device. 

* Install or update this ROM using the Mellanox Firmware Tools. (see below)
* To boot over Infiniband using PXE enable the "MLNX FlexBoot" device in the BIOS boot order.

**The DHCP servers require to support Infiniband MACs/LIDs**

Use following commands to query for an DHCP lease using an Infiniband device. If the DHCP server doesn't support IB following error messages are presented:

```bash
>>> dhcping -i ib0 -V | grep answer
no answer
>>> dhclient -v
Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client 4.2.2
[â€¦]
Unsupported device type 32 for "ib0"
```

Mellanox FlexBoot iPXE support the use of an DHCP client identifier and/or a MAC address.

The dhcp-client-identifier is prefixed with a static part followed by an 8-byte port GUID:

* Extract the GUID with `ibstat` on a running system 
* Alternatively read the GUID from the iPXE boot-screen. 

```
|------------- prefix -------------|------ port GUID -----| 
ff:00:00:00:00:00:02:00:00:02:c9:00:00:25:90:ff:ff:f7:d2:05
```

MAC-addresses are determined from the GUID by removing the 2-bytes in the middle.

```
         GUID                     MAC 
00:25:90:ff:ff:f7:d2:05 >> 00:25:90:f7:d2:05
```
