‘Degrowth’ principles for computing as a way to de-couple digital technology
from the growth-focused imperatives of capitalist economy.

* **Collapse Informatics** [^2], building systems in the abundant present that
  might later prove durable during subsequent times of scarcity.
* **Permacomputing** [^3] advocates the application of permaculture principles
  to the digital domain.
  - ... sustained through practices of re-use, repair, maintenance and
    non-waste.
  - Develop digital technologies that are drastically less reliant on
    artificial energy, and designed in ways that acknowledge their
    interdependence with natural systems.
* **Computing Within Limits** (CWL), reimagine the development of digital
  technology through principles of constraint and restraint...advocates for
  radically leaner and ecologically-aware approaches to developing and
  deploying digital technology across society
* **Salvage Computing**, extending the use of already available resources, and
  encouraging repair and reuse of existing computing technology. Future
  production of computing hardware should be based on longevity (designed for
  disassembly) rather than planned obsolescence (cf. "Right to Repair"
  movement).
