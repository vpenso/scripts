# Digital De-Growth

Increasing use of computational resources has become pervasive in today's
society. Until recently computing resources have effectively been treated as
infinite. Ridiculous hardware requirements for computing even of the most
trivial tasks have been create to support growth-focused (capitalist) economy
and marketing. Degrowth-principles for computing are required as way to
de-couple digital technology from the economically driven cycle of planned
obsolescence into **engineering for planned longevity**. We as a society need
to start treating computational resources as finite to be utilised as
efficiently as possible.

Greenhouse gas emissions related to computing resources are an increasingly
difficult challenge for the common goal of humanity to limit global warming
below 2°C before 2040:

* Global reduction from 55 to 23 GtCO₂ per year is needed. (Currently about 10
  GtCO₂ used to generate electricity. Renewable are projected to provide 30% of
  global electricity by 2040.)
* Today computers account for 3.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Growth
  in demand will not be offset by increased power efficiency (cf. end of Moors
  Law). Computing demand is likely to increase considerable (3-4 times) up to
  10-14% of global emissions budget by 2040. 
* Carbon emissions resulting from the production of computing devices exceeds
  those incurred during operation. Including the carbon cost of production
  would make computers responsible for 10 GtCO₂ per year in 2040. Almost **half
  of the acceptable CO₂ emission budget**.

The carbon footprint of computing resources needs to be dramatically reduced
for production and operation to meet the climate targets.

**Sustainable Computing** (zero-carbon computing, green IT) [^8]

* Treating computational resources as finite, utilised as effective as possible
* Integrated approach to reduce overall energy consumption across the entire
  infrastructure stack (data-center, edge devices, hardware, software, etc)
* Design software so that it supports devices with extended lifetimes
  (management of exploit vulnerabilities (cyper security))
* Consideration to deal with technical debt...

**Collapse Informatics** [^2], building systems in the abundant present that
might later prove durable during subsequent times of scarcity.

* Based on decentralization...current centralised services and networks fragile
  (natural disasters, infrastructure collapse due to economics, war, or sabotage)...
  peer-to-peer infrastructures are more resilient and flexible.
* Resiliency to intermittent energy supply and network connectivity.


**Permacomputing** [^3] advocates the application of permaculture principles
to the digital domain.

* ...sustained through practices of re-use, repair, maintenance and non-waste.
* Develop digital technologies that are drastically less reliant on artificial
  energy, and designed in ways that acknowledge their interdependence with
  natural systems.

**Computing Within Limits** (CWL), reimagine the development of digital
technology through principles of constraint and restraint...advocates for
radically leaner and ecologically-aware approaches to developing and
deploying digital technology across society

**Salvage Computing**, extending the use of already available resources, and
encouraging repair and reuse of existing computing technology. Future
production of computing hardware should be based on longevity (designed for
disassembly [^3] [^6]) rather than planned obsolescence (cf. "Right to
Repair" movement).

* ...how to make the best possible use out of the millions of devices which
  already exist.
* Encourages repairs, with the result that a product's life cycle is
  prolonged.
* "scavenge-friendly electronic parts" is parts that can be assembled with
  low-tech tools.

**Frugal Computing** [^5] aims to extend the shelf-life and energy efficiency
of successive generations of devices until the point is eventually reached
when “the world will have computing resources that last forever and hardly
use any energy”

**Minimalist Programming**, deliberate distancing from the current tolerance
of "bloat-ware".

* Encourages programmers to refactor and rewrite programs to keep them small
  and efficient
