Physiological aspect of the human eye:

* Visual field: approx. 200°, 120° binocular overlap
* Retinal resolution 0.3 to 0.7 arc minutes (depends on task/luminance)
* Temporal resolution: approx 50Hz (increases with luminance)
* Three types of photoreceptors:
  - Blur (450nm +/-30)
  - Green (550nm +/-40)
  - Red (600nm +/-35)



Display device is an output device to present information.

Electronic visual display (informally screen) technologies:

* **CRT** (cathode ray tube) 
* Segment display
* **LCD** (liquid crystal display)
  - **TFT** (thin-film transistor) LCD 
  - LCD with LED backlit
* **OLED** (organic light-emitting diode display)
* Plasma (plasma display panel)
* **QLED** (quantum dot LED)

Displays emitting light called **active**. 

Displays modulating available light (reflection/transmission) called **passive**.

## Resolution

Monitor resolution describes the visual dimensions of any given display. 

width x height |       |
---------------|-------|---------------
1280x720       | 720p  | HD 
1920x1080      | 1080p | FHD
2560x1440      | 1440p | QHD 2k
3840x2160      | 2160p | UHD 4k
5120x2160      |       |     5k
7680x4320      |       |     8k

**Aspect ratio** describes the correlation between width and height

**PPI** (pixels per inch) describes a monitor screen’s pixel density

### Synchronization Technology

Reduces screen tearing, and improves input lag:

* Occurs if the video feed is not synced to the display refresh rate)
* Solved by driving the screen refresh with the graphic device

G-Sync (Nvidia), or FreeSync (AMD) operate with **VRR** (variable refresh rate)

### Brightness

HDR (High Dynamic Range)
