Physiological aspect of the human eye:

* Visual field: approx. 200°, 120° binocular overlap
* Retinal resolution 0.3 to 0.7 arc minutes (depends on task/luminance)
* Temporal resolution: approx 50Hz (increases with luminance)
* Three types of photoreceptors:
  - Blur (450nm +/-30)
  - Green (550nm +/-40)
  - Red (600nm +/-35)

# Displays

Display device is an output device to present information.

Electronic visual display (informally screen) technologies:

* **CRT** (cathode ray tube) 
* Segment display
* **LCD** (liquid crystal display)
  - **TFT** (thin-film transistor) LCD 
  - LCD with LED backlit
* **OLED** (organic light-emitting diode display)
* Plasma (plasma display panel)
* **QLED** (quantum dot LED)

Displays emitting light called **active**. 

Displays modulating available light (reflection/transmission) called **passive**.

Modern displays are basically giant grids...

* ...each gird elements represented by a bit value encoding the color
  information
* individual gird elements are referred to as **pixel**

## Resolution

Number of pixels from left-to-right & top-to-bottom determines the **screen
resolution**. Monitor resolution describes the visual dimensions of any given
display. 

width x height | abbr. | marketing term
---------------|-------|---------------
1280x720       | 720p  | HD 
1920x1080      | 1080p | FHD
2560x1440      | 1440p | QHD 2k
3840x2160      | 2160p | UHD 4k
5120x2160      |       |     5k
7680x4320      |       |     8k

**Aspect ratio** describes the correlation between width and height

* 4:3 (640x480, 1024x768, 1600x1200) traditional screen resolutions
* 16:9 (1920x1200, 2560x1440, 3840x2160) widescreen

**PPI** (pixels per inch) describes a monitor screen’s pixel density...

* ...how fine-grained the individual pixels are
* The higher the PPI the better image quality will appear to the human eye
* similar to DPI (dots per inch) for printers

### Synchronization Technology

Reduces screen tearing, and improves input lag:

* Occurs if the video feed is not synced to the display refresh rate)
* Solved by driving the screen refresh with the graphic device

G-Sync (Nvidia), or FreeSync (AMD) operate with **VRR** (variable refresh rate)

### Brightness

HDR (High Dynamic Range)
