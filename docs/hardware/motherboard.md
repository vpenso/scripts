# Motherboard

Main circuit board to connect different build components of a computer.

* Also known as mainboard, system board, abbreviated to MB
* System Clock (CMOS Battery)
* Front Panel, connectors for external devices (i.e. USB, HDMI, Audio)
* **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System)
  - Performs hardware check after power on
  - Configurable with a system settings menu (boot devices, power settings, etc.)
* **Chipset**
  - Determines which components are compatible 
  - Dictates future expansion options
  - Enables overclocking of CPUs, RAM
  - Single-chip on modern systems directly connected to the CPU 
  - Intel Platform Controller Hub (PCH), Direct Media Interface (DIM)
  - AMD Fusion Controller Hub (FCH), Unified Media Interface (UMI)
* **VRM** (Voltage Regulator Module)
  - Senses the CPU voltage requirements
* SATA storage controller

### Form Factor

Size of the motherboard:

* **ATX**
  - 305x244mm
  - Full/Mid tower cases
  - Most common, de facto standard
  - Up to 7 expansion slots
  - Up to 8 memory slots
* **Micro-ATX**, UATX
  - 244x244mm
  - Less expensive
  - Max. 4 expansion slots
  - 2-4 memory slots
* **Mini-ITX** 
  - 170x170mm
  - Even less expensive
  - 1 expansion slot
  - Up to 2 memory slots

### Power Connectors

**ATX 24** pin 12V (ATX v2.2 standard)

- Connects the board to the PCU (Power Supply Unit)
- Molex 39-01-2240, often called a Molex Mini-fit Jr.
- ATX 20+4 for backwards compatability

**ATX/EPS** 8 pin 12V (EPS12V)
- Powers the processor voltage regulator
- Dedicated CPU power supply
- Molex 39-28-1083
- Not to confuse with 8 pin PCIe connectors

**P4** 4 pin ATX 12V

- Additional power connector (older boards)
- Molex 39-28-1043
- 8 pin connectors are backward compatible and are two 4-pin connectors
  connected to each other that can be separated.

### CPU Socket & Chipset

**Motherboards need to match/support the CPU!**

Following a couple of introduction material on Youtube:

* [An Introduction to Computer Chipsets][cs1] (2018)

Selection of chipset is relevant to overclocking and customization.

List of current sockets with corresponding chipset and CPU compatibility:

### AMD

* [AMD Chipset Differences: B550 Specs Explained vs. X570, B450, & Zen 3
Support][cs4] (2020)

CPU generations

- Ryzen 1000 series (1st)
- Ryzen 2000 series (2nd)
- Ryzen 3000 series (2rd)
- Ryzon 4000 series (4th), Zen 3

Socket **AM4**

- Chipset 300-series, 1st,2nd,3rd Gen CPUs
- Chipset 400-series, 1st,2nd,3rd Gen CPUs
- Chipset 500-series, 2nd,3rd,4th Gen CPUs

Chipset classes, X & B support overclocking

* Premium X{3,4,5}70
* Midrange B{3,4,5}50
* A{3,4,5}20

[AMD Socket AM4 Platform][cs3] list all chipsets

Following a couple of introduction material on Youtube:

Intel Socket **LGA 1151**

- Chipset 100 or 200-series for 6th/7th Gen CPUs (6700k,7700k)
- Chipset 300-series for 8th & 9th Gen CPUs (8700k,9900k)

Intel Socket **LGA 1200**

- Chipset 400-series for 10th Gen CPUs (10900k)
- List of [Intel Desktop Chipsets][cs2]

## Expansion Slots

**Expansion slots need to support the expansion card!**

Following a couple of introduction material on Youtube:

* [Explaining PCIe Slots][es1]
* [PCI Express (PCIe) 3.0 - Everything you Need to Know As Fast As
  Possible][es2]
* [PCI Express 4.0 as Fast As Possible][es3] (2018)

Motherboards support PCI Express (PCIe) slots:

* **PCIe x16** (de facto standard for video cards, GPUs)
* **PCIe x1** (network, audio, I/O interfaces)
* Replaces PCI, and AGP

`x{1,4,8,16}` indicates the number of parallel lanes.

Slots are downwards compatible (physical protection for wrong slotting)

**GPU expansion cards need to match the PCI generation for max. performance.**

PCIe generations:

Year  | Version | Speed (per lane)
------|---------|-----------------
2010  | **3.0** | 985MB/s
2017  | **4.0** | 1.97GB/s


## I/O Interfaces

Connectivity varies widely on motherboards, and have a huge impact on prices.

Located on the rear (or back) I/O panel, and on the motherboard surface

- **USB** for mouse, keyboard, microphones, cameras, storage, etc
- **NIC** typically Ethernet
- **Sound** input/output for headphones, and a microphone
- Some motherboards support integrated video (DisplayPort, HDMI)
- Some motherboards include Wifi, and Bluetooth
