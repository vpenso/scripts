# This configuration file lets you define new commands
# or change the shortcut or triggering keys of built-in verbs.
# You can change the colors of broot too.

#####################
# user defined verbs:

# If $EDITOR isn't set on your computer, you should either set it
#  or just replace it with your editor of choice in the 'execution'
#  pattern.
# Example:
#  execution = "/usr/bin/nvim {file}"
[[verbs]]
invocation = "edit"
key = "F2"
shortcut = "e"
execution = "$EDITOR {file}"

[[verbs]]
invocation = "create {subpath}"
execution = "$EDITOR {directory}/{subpath}"

# If $PAGER isn't set on your computer, you should either set it
#  or just replace it with your viewer of choice in the 'execution'
#  pattern.
# Example:
#  execution = "less {file}"
[[verbs]]
name = "view"
invocation = "view"
execution = "$PAGER {file}"
